#  Project #4: <u>HaroldCleworth.com</u>
### <u>Overview</u>

Previously, several people have tried to assist Harold with building out a website, with very little success.  

This project is a first pass at providing Harold with credit card authorization.

### <u>Build Approach</u>


Initially, we thought we would leverage Ruby on Rails and Spree with Sprite. However, after building a prototype, too much was going on under the hood.

We then began creating a site and shopping cart by hand. This led to many problems, although we did learn a great deal. Ultimately, we had to go back to some gems to try and manage the time constraints of the project.

Truly with more time, we would focus on Spree again due to the wealth of information provided on the back end.

Today is a basic view of where we are at the moment. We will continue to refine the site in the next few weeks to launch it live.

### <u>Homepage Metamorphosis</u>

Our original homepage layout included an embedded feed for a member’s own Facebook and Twitter account. However, it proved not to be viable for either embedded option. We could get our “own homepage app page” to display, but otherwise individual member feeds are locked down.

We also tried to incorporate geolocation to populate the weather display instead of manually asking for the member’s zipcode. Unfortunately, the weather app would not function correctly with exact member latitude and longitude coordinates.
